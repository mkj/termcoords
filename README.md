# Terminal with Coordinates

This is a USB serial terminal for Android. 
The difference is that it can log the output lines to a .csv file with added GPS coordinates.

I wrote this to record signals from a Lora module + RP Pico plugged into a phone.

## Credits

Most of the app came from Kai Morich's [SimpleUsbTerminal](https://github.com/kai-morich/SimpleUsbTerminal). His full app [Serial USB Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_usb_terminal) is a nice program too.

USB serial parts use the [usb-serial-for-android](https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android) library.
